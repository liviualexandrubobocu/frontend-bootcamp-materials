1. write a base class called RegularShape whose constructor receives the number
   of sides and the length of a side. write at least two derived classes that extend
   RegularShape, representing two different regular shapes,
   containing a method called getArea, which must return the area of the
   shape, using the two arguments that the parent class should receive.
